# Why do I code 
The most important reason why I do code is... that I really enjoy it. As simple as it may sound, coding gives me a lot of satisfaction and makes me happy. I find it very similar to solving riddles. And the best part is, usually there is no “the one and only” proper way of doing it. Different people create different solutions for the same problem and share them to with community. And it is awesome. Whenever I have this opportunity, I love to compare my way of thinking with that of other people. Not only can I discover more ways of solving the same problem, but also I often have a chance to learn new tools.

My first encounter with coding was during my university days, right after high school.  It was… almost love at first sight. Unfortunately, after that wonderful and full of happiness adventure at university, I abandoned coding and walked the different path, which I regret nowadays. After years of working in automotive industry, I realized I was burned out and I wanted something else. One of very few things I still liked in my day-to-day work was time spending on creation of formulas and macros in Excel. 

Back then I decided, I must change my current career path. I started studying Computer Science at Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology and… now I am happy. And I know this is the right path for me.
